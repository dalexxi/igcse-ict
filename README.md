# This repository was built using the same code from tunapanda https://github.com/tunapanda/h5p-standalone/tree/1.3.x. and https://github.com/LanceRoe/h5p-selfhost-example
# I modified the processs to directly host direct html files exported from H5P created in LUMI. No need to add contents in 'Demo' folder as the workspace folder would be directly referenced in the index.
